Official implentation of CVPR 2023 paper [*GANHead: Towards Generative Animatable Neural Head Avatars*](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Wu_GANHead_Towards_Generative_Animatable_Neural_Head_Avatars_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf).
### Code Comming Soon! ðŸ˜‰


## Training
### Prepare Data
First download [FaceVerse dataset](https://github.com/LizhenWangT/FaceVerse-Dataset) following their instructions.
Next, run the pre-processing script to get ground truth occupancy, surface color and normal, and rendered multiview images and normal maps:
```
python preprocess.py --tot 1 --id 0 --scan_folder <folder_to_raw_scans> --flame_folder <folder_to_flame_parameters> --output_folder <>
```
